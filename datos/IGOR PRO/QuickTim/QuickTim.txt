Igor Pro uses QuickTime to import and export various graphic formats and
to produce movies using the NewMovie and AddMovieFrame operations.

Apple Computer Inc. does not allow others to redistribute QuickTime, so you
will need to download the free version from their web site or purchase
the QuickTime Pro version from a retailer.

Quicktime 4.12 or later is recommended, and can be downloaded from Apple's
website at:

           http://www.apple.com/quicktime

Igor can function very well without QuickTime, but of course with slightly
diminished capability.
