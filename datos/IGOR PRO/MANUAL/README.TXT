For convenience and speed, we suggest that you allow the installer to
install the Manual folder on your hard disk. This will require about 20
megabytes. Or you can drag the Manual folder from the CD-ROM into
your Igor Pro Folder.

Once you have installed Acrobat Reader, you can view the manual by
double-clicking the Manual.pdf file.

The PDF manual includes an index suitable for searching using the Search
tool in Acrobat Reader 4.0. This search capability makes the online manual
very convenient.
