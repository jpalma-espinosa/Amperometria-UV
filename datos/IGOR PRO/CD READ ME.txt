ABOUT THIS CD
  This CD contains items that may or may not be copied to your
  hard drive by the Igor 4.0 Installer (setup.exe), depending on
  whether you perform a custom or compact installation.

  The optional files are the Manual, Adobe Acrobat Reader installer
  (rs405eng.exe), UpdateIgorToLatestVersion.exe, and the associated
  LatestIgorFiles.ivs data file.

  The FTPSITE.zip file is never copied to your hard drive.
  See FTP SITE, below for details.
 
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  Igor Pro requires Windows 95, Windows 98, NT 4.0
  Windows 2000, or Windows ME (Millenium Edition).

  IGOR DOES NOT RUN UNDER WINDOWS 3.1
  IGOR DOES NOT RUN UNDER WINDOWS NT 3.5

RUNNING THE INSTALLER
  If the Igor installer does not automatically launch, double-click
  setup.exe to install Igor and supporting files to your hard drive.

  You will need about 30 MB on your hard drive to install Igor Pro
  plus another 35MB to install the optional UpdateIgorToLatestVersion.exe
  and the associated LatestIgorFiles.ivs data file.

  When prompted, enter your serial number and activation key.
  These are printed on a card you received with your copy of IGOR Pro.
  Look for a card with "IMPORTANT!" written on it. You will need this whenever
  you install or update Igor using the CD Installer.

UPGRADING IGOR
  For those people upgrading from previous versions of Igor, here is the
  recommended upgrading procedure:
    1. Backup your own Igor Pro files, and any WaveMetrics-supplied files
        that you have modified. Put them someplace where you won't accidently
        overwrite them, such as a Zip Disk.
    2. Uninstall the previous version of Igor Pro (autorun.exe will prompt
        you to do this).
    3. Install Igor Pro 4.
    4. Open your old Igor Pro files with the new Igor but save them
        in a different folder.
    5. If you have modified any WaveMetrics-supplied procedure files, you
        will need to manually compare them to the new files, and make any
        revisions you deem necessary.

  We also recommend you peruse the help file "What's New In Igor Pro 4" help
  file: it explains the changes and additions from Igor Pro 3.1 to 4. 

  The Igor support files (help, procedures, examples, extensions) that come
  with Igor Pro 4 are similar but not identical to the files shipped with
  previous versions. Some are identical, but renamed. To keep things straight,
  we recommend that you not mix WaveMetrics-supplied version 4 files with
  any previous version.

UPDATING IGOR TO THE LATEST VERSION
  Use UpdateIgorToLatestVersion.exe on the CD or choose "Update Igor to
  the Latest Version" from the Igor file group (in the Start menu).

  In either case you will need a connection to the Internet. The installer
  or updater will download changed files and install them. If the Igor
  application has changed, you will need your serial number and installation
  key in order to install the downloaded application.

  The downloaded changed files will not need to be downloaded again because
  they are stored at the root volume of hard drive with the most amount of
  free space in an "Igor Pro Download Data" folder.

ONLINE MANUAL
  This version of Igor Pro ships with a printed Getting Started manual
  and a full online manual set as PDF (Adobe Acrobat Portable Document
  Format) files on the CD-ROM.

  The installer by default copies the PDF-format manual to your hard
  drive, but you can save some disk space by deselecting that option and
  use the Manual files on the CD-ROM.

  In either case, to use the online manual you will need Adobe Acrobat
  Reader 4 or later (or Acrobat Exchange).  The Igor Installer will launch
  an Acrobat Reader Installer if version 4 or later can't be located. Acrobat
  Reader installers and further instructions in a ReadMe file are also on the
  CD-ROM in the Manual folder. 

PRINTED MANUAL
  The printed Igor Pro manual can be ordered from WaveMetrics.

INSTALLING FROM A NETWORK SERVER
  You can install Igor Pro from files copied to a file server.
  Your administrator should copy the all files from the CD-ROM
  (except FTPSITE.ZIP) onto your file server.  From your client computer,
  double-click setup.exe file on the server.  Proceed as described above
  in RUNNING THE INSTALLER.
