PLEASE RETURN YOUR REGISTRATION CARD

In the past, we have sent free bug-fix updates to all
registered Igor users. (If you are upgrading from a
previous version of Igor, you are already registered
and will receive no registration card.)  

UPGRADING IGOR

For those people upgrading from previous versions of Igor,
here is the recommended upgrading procedure:

1. Backup your own Igor Pro files, and any
   WaveMetrics-supplied files that you have modified.
   Put them someplace where you won't accidently overwrite
   them, such as a Zip Disk. (Lock them in a cabinet,
   but keep the key.)
2. Uninstall Igor 3.1.
3. Install Igor Pro 4.
4. Open your old Igor Pro files with the new Igor but
   save them in a different folder.

If you have modified any WaveMetrics-supplied procedure files,
you will need to manually compare them to the new files, and
make any revisions you deem necessary.

We recommend you peruse the "What's New In Igor Pro 4" help
file; it explains the changes and additions from Igor Pro 3.1 to 4.

GETTING IGOR NEWS

There are several ways to keep up with the latest Igor
news and get the latest tech notes and what-not.  

  Igor Mailing List

  List-Subscribe: mailto:listmanager@pica.army.mil?subject=subscribe%20igor
  List-Unsubscribe: mailto:listmanager@pica.army.mil?subject=unsubscribe%20igor

  To post to the list, mail to mailto:igor@pica.army.mil.

  Administrative issues such as subscription and deletion requests
  should be addressed to mailto:listmanager@pica.army.mil.

  FTP
  There are several FTP sites containing Igor-related
  files. The d31rz0 site is the main site and gets
  files before the others. Note: d31rz0 is
  dee-three-one-ar-zee-zero. 

  Main site:  ftp://d31rz0.stanford.edu/WaveMetrics/

  A copy of the FTP site is on the CD-ROM as FTPSITE.ZIP.
  You can use Aladdin Expander 5.0 from Aladdin Systems, Inc.
  to uncompress the file. It Aladdin Expander can be downloaded
  from:

    http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/index.html

    Note: Many of the FTP files are encoded as BinHexed StuffIt
    Macintosh-format files. Aladdin Expander will allow you to
    open the data fork of Macintosh files (you won't need and
    can't use the Macintosh resource fork on a PC). This is
    especially useful for opening Igor procedure (text) files
    that have been saved in BinHex format.
