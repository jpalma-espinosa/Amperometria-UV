This is a special folder.

You can put Igor procedure files in here or shortcuts pointing to procedure
files or to folders containing procedure files. When Igor starts up, if it
finds any procedure files in this folder or referenced via shortcuts, it will
open them automatically.

Such procedure files are called "global" procedure files and
are not part of any experiment but are available to all experiments.

You should put only those procedures that you expect to use from
nearly all of your experiments in this folder.

NOTE:
	If you put a procedure file in this folder and then use its procedures
  in an experiment then that experiment will depend on the procedure
  file. If you transfer the experiment to another computer, you will need
  to transfer the procedure file also. If you forget the procedure
  file then the experiment will not work on the other computer.

NOTE:
  It is best if you save your own files in your own folder outside the
  Igor Pro Folder. This makes it possible for you to upgrade Igor in the
  future without worrying about losing your own files. To facilite this,
  create a folder named Igor Global Procedures outside the Igor Pro folder.
  Now make a shortcut for your Igor Global Procedures folder, and drag it
  into the Igor Procedures folder. When Igor starts up, it will automatically
  open any procedure file that you store in your Igor Global Procedures
  folder, or in any a subfolder.
